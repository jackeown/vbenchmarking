% Domain   : Data Structures
% Problem  : Associativity of list append
% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Associativity of list append. The proof is by induction with a 
%            problem file for the base and step case (with multiple subcases)
%            as well as the correct instantiation of the induction axiom for
%            lists. The main file uses the conjectures of the other files as
%            lemmas in order to prove the final result. To simplify proof
%            search, the axioms in each problem file have been preselected.
